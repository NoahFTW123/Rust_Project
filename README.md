## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I need to fix the hangman character itself. I tried to get it to look nice but I was having trouble.
* [ ] Have different api's that have easier, medium, and harder words for the difficulty.
* [ ] I am having issues with the attempts and the hangman being drawn that I need to fix.
